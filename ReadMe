This is something I made pretty recently. I want to get better at making Unity games because the last games jam I joined
barely functional, So I got a book on programming in C#. This is the final exercise BEFORE
OOP (so its just methods and basic stuff).
uses alot of 'advanced' basic stuff, from fizzbuzz to switch statements, which I think is a good indication of where I'm at.


Hopefully once I get the hang of OOP for real I'll finally make the tetris clone I've always wanted to make, but until then this is where I'm at.
